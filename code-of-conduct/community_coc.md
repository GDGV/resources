# Community Code Of Conduct

All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at our events are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the events. We are expecting cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment for everybody.

> tl;dr: Be excellent with each other


#### The Quick Version

GDG Cloud Vancouver is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of event participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any event venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Event participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the event without a refund (if applicable) at the discretion of the GDG Cloud Vancouver organizers.

#### The Less Quick Version

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.

Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualized images, or other material. 

If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, the event organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event with no refund (if applicable). If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact an organizer immediately.

Organizers will be happy to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event.

We value your attendance. We expect participants to follow these rules at events and workshop venues and event-related social events.
